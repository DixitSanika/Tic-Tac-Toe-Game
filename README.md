# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

For my Tic-Tac-Toe game, I used the Tkinter library to create an interactive graphical user interface (GUI). The grid consists of buttons, and each click updates the board with 'X' or 'O'. The code includes logic to check for a winner or a draw after each move. It also displays the results in a user-friendly manner and provides an option to restart the game. This task helped me explore GUI development, event handling, and Python's core functionalities.
